/* Question 4:
We want to find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders 
during every month for all the years we have data for. 
Write a query that returns the store ID for the store, the year and month 
and the number of rental orders each store has fulfilled for that month. 
Your table should include a column for each of the following: year, month, store ID and count of rental orders 
fulfilled during that month. */

select	date_part ('month', r.rental_date) AS rental_month, 
		date_part ('year', r.rental_date) AS rental_year,
       	se.store_id,COUNT(*) AS count_rental
from		store se, staff sf, rental r
where 	se.store_id = sf.store_id and
		sf.staff_id = r.staff_id
GROUP BY 	rental_month, rental_year, se.store_id
ORDER BY	count_rental desc
